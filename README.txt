Mini Open Adaptive Controller firmware
======================================

Firmware examples for the Mini Open Adaptive Controller. We have
experimented with different OLEDs and libraries during development,
so this is a collection of the different firmware versions.

The most recent hardware uses a 128x64 OLED with the SH1106 driver.
